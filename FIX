eMatch — Overview 📊
eMatch is a data-driven application designed to support analysis, monitoring, and reporting through a single, unified, and highly configurable graphical interface. It centralizes access to business modules and provides strong data exploration tools—especially through grids—so users can investigate information, track indicators, and extract data in multiple formats without losing context. The platform is intended for both daily operational activities and deeper analytical work, particularly when working with large datasets and frequent filtering, querying, and exporting.

Key Features ✨
Flexibility and Usability
eMatch is built to fit different workflows and user profiles by allowing the interface to be shaped around operational needs. Users can customize dashboards, adjust data views, and use bookmarks to return to stable working contexts efficiently. Data exploration is supported by advanced grid functionality (sorting, filtering, column management, summaries) and by embedded spreadsheet-style capabilities that enable additional manipulation and calculations directly inside the application. For advanced data investigation, eMatch also provides a dedicated SQL requester that supports query execution and reusable query management.

Functional Integrity ✅
Reliability and continuity are core principles in eMatch. The application emphasizes consistent data presentation across modules and views, and it supports persistence of user context to reduce repetitive setup and improve productivity. Bookmarks and saved configurations are key elements of this approach, allowing users to restore layouts, filters, and sorting. Access to screens and data is controlled through role-based permissions, ensuring appropriate visibility and maintaining data security.

Performance and User Feedback ⚡
eMatch is designed to remain usable while handling large volumes of data. During operations that can require processing time—such as filtering, executing queries, copying large selections, and exporting—the interface provides clear feedback so users understand what is happening and can avoid uncertainty during long-running actions. This improves predictability and supports both routine usage and heavier analytical workflows.

Purpose of This Documentation 🎯
This document is a QA-oriented reference to support reliable validation of eMatch across cycles and releases. It is organized into navigation tabs so each subject can be detailed in its own page, keeping this section concise. The goal is to standardize expected behavior, measure confidence through coverage, guide automation execution, and define the release validation process end-to-end.

Documentation Tabs / Sections
Functional Overview ✅
Establishes the functional baseline QA must validate. It summarizes the application’s main areas (menu/navigation, dashboards, bookmarks, grids, exports, spreadsheet mode, SQL requester) and the expected behavior for each. Detailed flows, edge cases, and acceptance criteria are documented inside this tab.

Test Coverage 🧪
Defines testing scope and how coverage is measured. It maps test scenarios per functionality and tracks how many tests exist for each area, helping indicate the current confidence level and quality maturity by feature. It also maintains traceability between changes, test cases, defects, and releases.

Automation Tests 🤖
Guides how automation is executed and supported during releases. It includes setup and configuration required to run the suites, architecture orientation, execution steps, and common errors with troubleshooting guidance. It also documents suite organization and maintenance rules to keep automation stable and usable.

Report 📌
Centralizes release follow-up communication. It records the daily status of open defects and test execution progress, with updates delivered twice per day. It also preserves the historical view of the release period—what was tested, what failed, what was fixed, and how stability evolved over time across REC and PRD.

Release 🚀
Defines the release testing workflow and final quality gates. It covers entry/exit criteria, the execution sequence across release moments, validation in REC and PRD (including data comparison where applicable), and the final consolidation of results. This tab represents the final delivery: the end-state snapshot of testing, defects, and application health used for sign-off.


1. Functional Overview ✅

The Functional Overview is the baseline reference for how eMatch is expected to behave. It aligns QA, developers, and stakeholders on what each feature does, what “correct behavior” means, and which interactions are essential to validate. This page is intentionally high-level: it introduces the topics and sets a consistent structure that will be expanded later with detailed flows, edge cases, and acceptance criteria.

The section is organized by the core areas of the application so validation remains consistent across releases. It covers navigation and user entry points (Menu), daily operational visibility (Dashboard), productivity features (Bookmarks), data extraction mechanisms (Export Methods), large-data exploration tools (Grid Features), and advanced investigation capabilities (SQL Requester). It also establishes expectations for usability, user interaction patterns, and error handling so QA validates both the happy path and the robustness of the experience.

Core areas covered in this section:

🧭 Menu: navigation structure, screen discovery, and tab behavior.

📊 Dashboard: indicators, filters, layout management, and persistence expectations.

🔖 Bookmarks: save/restore behavior and persisted state.

📤 Export Methods: export formats, copy behavior, and spreadsheet-mode expectations.

🧩 Grid Features: filtering, column management, summaries, sorting/grouping, and state consistency.

🧑‍💻 SQL Requester: query execution flow, outputs, and access boundaries.

2. Test Coverage 🧪

The Test Coverage section explains how we measure confidence in eMatch quality. Its purpose is to make coverage visible and measurable by mapping scenarios to each functionality and showing how protected each area is based on the number and type of tests already implemented. This page becomes the reference to understand what is in scope for validation, what is covered by tests today, and where additional tests are required to raise safety over time.

Coverage is structured per feature and linked to CT scenarios so QA can quantify maturity per module rather than relying on subjective impressions. It also maintains traceability from changes and requirements to test assets and defects, ensuring that critical behaviors are validated and that gaps are identified early—especially during release cycles with frequent retesting.

What you will find here:

🎯 Testing scope: boundaries by feature and environment.

🧩 Scenario mapping per functionality: CT scenarios to measure how tested each area is.

📈 Confidence by feature: quality maturity based on test volume and test type (smoke, regression, exploratory).

🔗 Traceability: Change/Requirement → Scenarios → Test Cases → Defects → Release.

🗓️ Execution strategy: how manual and automated testing are combined during releases.

3. Automation Tests 🤖

The Automation Tests section defines how automation supports repeatable validation of eMatch, especially during release periods that require frequent execution and fast feedback. The goal is to provide a clear baseline for how automation is prepared, executed, and interpreted so results are consistent across runs, environments, and testers.

This page introduces the topics that will later be detailed: how to configure Katalon correctly, how to run locally and remotely, how Jenkins is used to execute release runs, how reports integrate with Jira, and how to troubleshoot common execution issues. It also documents automation execution constraints (including Windows-level interactions) so failures can be understood quickly and retesting remains efficient.

What you will find here:

⚙️ Setup and configuration: Katalon settings, execution profiles, environment selection (REC/PRD), dependencies, and prerequisites.

▶️ Execution model and order: suite organization and standard run sequence during a release.

🧱 Jenkins and remote execution: how release runs are triggered, parameterized, and stored as artifacts.

🗂️ Jira integration and reporting: how results link to defects and how evidence is standardized.
🛠️ Common configuration issues: typical Katalon/environment failures and Windows execution constraints.
🖥️ Local execution, Windows simulator, and scheduling: local debug runs, Windows automation flows, and task scheduling guidance.

4. Reports 📌
The Reports section standardizes how QA communicates progress, risks, and application health throughout the release window. Reporting is designed for two purposes: provide real-time clarity for decision-making and preserve a historical record of how the release evolved across repeated runs and defect fixes.
Because eMatch release validation typically involves multiple execution moments (test → identify defects → follow corrections → re-run), reporting must be consistent and comparable. This section introduces how updates are produced twice per day, how defect position is tracked, and how results are summarized across REC and PRD to build an accurate picture of stability over time.

This page introduces:
🧾 Testing reports: what must be included in each update (scope executed, pass/fail, blockers, key changes).
🐞 Defect tracking: lifecycle, severity/priority rules, resolution status, and environment linkage (REC/PRD).
📧 Email reports (2x/day): structured communication that captures the status “snapshot” and builds the release timeline for future reference.

5. Release 🚀
The Release section defines the end-to-end playbook for validating and closing a release cycle. It connects planning, execution, defect follow-up, and retesting cadence into a consistent process that can be repeated every release with predictable outcomes.
This page introduces the release rhythm used for eMatch: multiple validation moments across a defined period, repeated execution 1–2 times per day, and validation in both REC and PRD, including comparison of behavior and data where applicable. The release concludes with a final consolidated snapshot of test outcomes, defect status, and overall application health that supports sign-off.

This section introduces:
🗺️ Release planning and scope: what is included and which areas are impacted.
🌍 Execution strategy and environments: how REC and PRD validations are organized during the release period.
✅ Quality gates: entry/exit criteria and decision points for approval.
📸 Final delivery snapshot: the final picture of testing results, defect position, and quality by feature.
