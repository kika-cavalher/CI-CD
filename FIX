Hi team,

Following up on yesterday’s meeting, here is a summary of the key points and agreed next steps for this release:

Test execution handover: The execution responsibility is transitioning from Conceição to Erica. Erica will lead test execution for this release, with Conceição providing support throughout.

Increased test workload: The test suite will be larger than usual due to year-end closing activities, which may increase overall execution time.

Acapulco testing scope: We will not execute Acapulco tests in this release, given the high number of recent changes, unless time allows us to correct the tests. In parallel, we will work on these corrections as soon as possible.

Email reporting cadence: We will maintain the same email reporting approach as the previous release, sharing progress summaries twice per day.

Value discrepancies: Any value discrepancies identified during testing should be recorded. In February, we will work on defining an acceptable tolerance for these validations.

Thank you to everyone involved for the collaboration and support.
Wishing you all a great week ahead.

Best regards,
Erica
