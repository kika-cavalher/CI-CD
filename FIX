Introduction – eMatch GUI

eMatch is a data-driven application designed to support analysis, monitoring, and reporting through a unified and highly configurable graphical interface. It enables users to efficiently access business modules, visualize key indicators, manage large datasets, and extract information in multiple formats, all from a centralized environment.

The platform is built around flexibility and usability, allowing users to tailor dashboards, grids, and bookmarks to their operational needs. Through advanced grid features, embedded spreadsheet capabilities, and a dedicated SQL Requester, eMatch supports both standard users and advanced users who require deeper data exploration.

From a functional perspective, eMatch emphasizes data consistency, state persistence, and controlled access through role-based permissions. Its interface is designed to handle large volumes of data while providing clear feedback during user actions such as exports, filtering, and query execution, making it suitable for daily operational use as well as detailed analytical work.

This documentation focuses on the observable behaviors, functional capabilities, and testable aspects of the eMatch GUI, serving as a foundation for quality assurance activities, functional validation, and regression testing.
